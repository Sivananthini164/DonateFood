In Sri Lanka, the larger the marriage, the larger the party, and also the additional stupendous the waste.Nearly 14% of the total food produced globally is lost between the harvest and retail stages. Sri Lanka's contribution to wasted food, at 68.8 million tonnes annually, is 7% of the global total, per the United Nations Environment Programme's Food Waste Index Report 2021. <br> <br>
